# AutoExcuseSchool
The code in this project is currently undocumented, but it should be readable and understandable on its own. 
Certain components such as the actual document template used for generating excuses are not included, along with other elements that may contain sensitive information for OpSec reasons.

This project is intended primarily as a reference for building custom web crawlers. For example, see the Microsoft.py file, which demonstrates how to interact with Microsoft login endpoints.

(Actually, this is just part of my application.)
